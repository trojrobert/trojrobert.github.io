## What is Microsoft Azure Fundamental AZ-900 Exam?

[Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/2-what-is-azure) is a platform from Microsoft that provides cloud services to help individuals and organizations meet their current and future business challenges. Azure helps with building, managing, deploying applications on a massive global network. We have other cloud service providers like [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/)(AWS), [Google Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://eu.alibabacloud.com/), [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) and others. Cloud Services reduce cost, increase scalability, availability, reliability, and security.
[AZ-900 Exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) certifies your knowledge of Microsoft Azure Fundamentals. It is meant for beginners in cloud computing and people that want to demonstrate a foundational knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. You don’t need any technical background to pass the exams but a technical background would make things easier. There are other Microsoft Azure certification exams like DP-100 for Azure Data Scientist Associate, AI-100 for azure AI Engineer Associate and the list keeps increasing regular.

## What I did  to pass the AZ-900 Exam

It was the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in Germany and I had just concluded my   final exams for my masters program in Data Analytics(Machine Learning and Big Data) . Taking safety precautions to stay at home and practice social distancing, I leveraged the free time to learn Azure Fundamentals by spending about 6 -8 hours for 4 days to prepare for the exams. There are 4 ways to take in the exams.

* At a local test center
* At my home or office
* At a Certiport test center
* I have a private Access code

Following these options you have a choice of your desired date and time to take the exam. My preference was to take it at home and I took the test on March 24th, 2020. To prepare for the exam, I utilized the following free resources below, though some paid tutorials could make it easier.  
 
### Free resources I used


1. [Microsoft Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free.) - this is a free azure account that comes with  a 12 months validity. $200 free credit is offered for the first 30 days and more than 25 products are accessible for free afterwards. I was able to pass my AZ-900 exams without the need for a Microsoft Azure subscription.

2. [Microsoft Learn Platform for Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) – this is a free online tutorial provided by Microsoft, mostly text based with a few short video clips, that explain all the important Azure concepts. It consists of 12 modules as of the time I wrote the exam. It is estimated to take 9hrs 48 mins of study time but expect to spend much more time studying the material. It took me 2 full days to complete it.  
 
3. [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/az-900-exam-preparation-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-524/) – this is an online video tutorial with free 7 days of trial. The course has a duration of 10 hours 32 minutes. This will help you solidify your knowledge. It contains 13 videos and is taught by Guy Hummel an Azure and Google Cloud Content lead. It took me one and a half full days to complete it.
 
There are other very good paid courses though I didn’t use any of them, exapmles are [Microsoft Instructor-led course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/az-900t01), [Udemy AZ-900 Azure Exam Prep: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals in 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/az-900-azure-exam-prep-understanding-cloud-concepts/), [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Prep-2020 edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/az900-azure/), [Microsoft Azure – Beginner’s Guide + AZ-900 preparation](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-azure-beginners-guide/) and
 [Whizlabs AZ-900 Exam Practices Tests](https://www.whizlabs.com/login/)
 
 
## Structure of the AZ-900 exam 
The exam will test your knowledge in 4 models
* Cloud Concepts (15-20%)
* Core Azure Service (30-35%)
* Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust (25-30%)
* Azure Pricing and Support (20-25%)

[**Price**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) – The exam cost 99 euros (rising to 120 euros with VAT)  in Germany and varies by country. In the USA, it costs $99. You can get a discount if you are a Microsoft Imagine Academy program member, Microsoft Partner Network program member or a Microsoft Certified Trainer. You can cancel the appointment 6 business days before the exam day to get a full refund.

**Questions** –I completed 41 questions but I learnt it can vary between 40 – 60 questions. The questions come in different formats: short answer, repeated answer choices, build a list, multiple-choice, mark review, review screen, active screen, best answer, drag and drop, etc. Note you are not required to type (input) any answer during the exam.

**Duration** – The exam lasted for 60 minutes but the scheduled time varies between 85 -90 minutes taking the time required for reading the exam guidelines, taking a survey and providing a review into account.

**Exam structure and Score** - You have the opportunity to select some questions for review, which will give you the opportunity to review and correct them before the final submission. After the final submission, you have another 10 minutes to see all the answers you supplied but this time you cannot make any corrections. To pass the exams you need to a total of at least 700. Your exam report will be available immediately after you finish. This report contains your total score, pass or fail status and a bar chart showing performance in key areas of the exam. The certificate will be out about 2 days after the exam. You have the opportunity to retake the exam after 24 hours if you fail.

*My Microsoft Azure Fundamental Certificate*
I also thought Microsoft Azure Fundamentals at the [5-days AI everyday Virtual Bootcamp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J-zmJ05sG3Y&t=13s), this video can be of help. After you have passed the AZ-900 exam, you can decide to move forward by taking one of the associate certifications.  I wrote an article on [Becoming an Azure Data Scientist Associate: How to pass DP-100 exam](https://trojrobert.github.io/becoming-an-azure-data-scientist-associate-how-to-pass-dp-100-exam/). I wish you the best as you start the journey in Cloud computing and in your exam.  Happy Learning!!!
