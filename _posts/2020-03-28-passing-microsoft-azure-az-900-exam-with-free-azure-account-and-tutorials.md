## What is Microsoft Azure Fundamental AZ-900 Exam?

[Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/welcome-to-azure/2-what-is-azure) is a platform from Microsoft that provide cloud services to help individuals and organizations meet their current and future business challenges. Azure helps with building, managing, deploying applications on a massive global network. We have other cloud service providers like [Amazon Web Service](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Google Cloud](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Alibaba Cloud](https://eu.alibabacloud.com/), [IBM Cloud](https://www.ibm.com/cloud) and others. Cloud Services reduce cost, increase scalability, availability, reliability, and security.
[AZ-900 Exam](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) certifies your knowledge in Microsoft Azure Fundamentals, it is meant for beginners in cloud computing and people that want to demonstrate foundational level knowledge of cloud services and how those services are provided with Microsoft Azure. You don’t need any technical background to pass the exams but a technical background would make things easier. There are other Microsoft Azure certification exams like DP-100 for Azure Data Scientist Associate, AI-100 for azure AI Engineer Associate, … this list keeps updating every day.

## What did I do to pass the AZ-900 Exam?

A little about me before I wrote AZ-900 exams. I was about finishing my masters in Data Analytics(Machine Learning and Big Data), I have little or no knowledge using Azure. I wrote my exams on March 24th, 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic, since I was home and practicing social distancing, I use the opportunity to develop myself I add new skills.
I spent about 4 days studying an average of 6 -8 hours to prepare for the exams. There are 4 ways to take in the exams.
* At a local test center
* At my home or office
* At a Certiport test center
* I have a private Access code

You select one of these options, after these, you select the time and date you for the exam. I selected "at my home or office" and the time was in pacific daylight time(US) zone. I prepared for the exam with only free tutorials and a free Microsoft Azure account, though some paid tutorials could make it easier. 
 
### What free tutorials and account did I use?


1. [Microsoft Azure free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free.) - this is a free azure account with access for 12 months, $200 credit to spend for the first 30 days and more than 25 products. I was able to pass my AZ-900 exams without passing for exam Microsoft Azure subscription

2. [Microsoft Learn Platform for Azure Fundamentals](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/paths/azure-fundamentals/) – this is a free online tutorial provided by Microsoft, it contain 90% texts with a few short videos. It explains all the important concert you need to pass the exam, it has 12 modules as of the time I wrote the exam, it is estimated to take 9hrs 48 mins but since you will take notes and try to read it properly to understand the new concept well you may spend more time on it. It took me 2 full days to complete it.  
 
3. [Cloud Academy](https://cloudacademy.com/learning-paths/az-900-exam-preparation-microsoft-azure-fundamentals-524/) – this is an online video tutorial with a free 7 days trial, the course has a duration of 10 hours 32 minutes. This will help you solidify your knowledge, it contains 13 videos and is taught by Guy Hummel an Azure and Google Cloud Content lead. It took me one and a half full days to complete it. 
 
There are a lot of very good paid courses I didn’t use any of them, examples are [Microsoft Instructor-led course](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/courses/az-900t01), [Udemy AZ-900 Azure Exam Prep: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals in 2020](https://www.udemy.com/course/az-900-azure-exam-prep-understanding-cloud-concepts/), [AZ-900: Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Exam Prep-2020 edition](https://www.udemy.com/course/az900-azure/), [Microsoft Azure – Beginner’s Guide + AZ-900 preparation](https://www.udemy.com/course/microsoft-azure-beginners-guide/) and
 [Whizlabs AZ-900 Exam Practices Tests](https://www.whizlabs.com/login/)
 
 
## What does the AZ-900 exam look like?
The exam will test your knowledge in 4 models
* Cloud Concepts (15-20%)
* Core Azure Service (30-35%)
* Security, Privacy, Compliance, and Trust (25-30%)
* Azure Pricing and Support (20-25%)

[**Price**](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/az-900) – The exam cost 99 euros since I am in Germany, the price varies by country, in the USA it cost $99. Though the euro has more value than the dollar I don’t understand the economics behind that. Note after adding VAT it cost about 120 euros. You can get a reduction if you are a Microsoft Imagine Academy program member, Microsoft Partner Network program member or a Microsoft Certified Trainer. You can cancel the appointment 6 business days before the exam day to get a full refund.

**Questions** – I had 41 questions though I learn it can vary between 40 – 60 questions. There are different formats of questions like short answer, repeated answer choices, build a list, multiple-choice, mark review, review screen, active screen, best answer, drag and drop, etc. Note you are not required to type (input) any answer during the exam.

**Duration** – the exam itself is 60 minutes but the scheduled time varies between 85 -90 minutes which involves reading the exam guidelines, taking a survey and a review.

**Exam structure and Score** - You have the opportunity to select some questions for review, which will give you the opportunity to review and correct them before the final submission. After the final submission, you have another 10 minutes opportunity to review all the question but this time you can not make any corrections. To pass the exams you need to a total of at least 700, your exam report will be available immediately after you finish. This report contains your total score, pass or fail status and a bar chart showing performance in key areas of the exam. The certificate will be out about 2 days after the exam, you have the opportunity to retake the exam after 24 hours if you fail.
