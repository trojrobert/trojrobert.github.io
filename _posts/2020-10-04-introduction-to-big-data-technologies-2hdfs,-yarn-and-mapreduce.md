In my first article in this series [Introduction to Big Data Technologies 1: Hadoop Core Components](https://medium.com/@trojrobert/introduction-to-big-data-technologies-1-hadoop-core-components-9b184d80f87b), I explained what is meant by Big Data, the 5 Vs of Big Data, and brief definitions of all the major components of Hadoop ecosystem.  In this article, we will be diving into 3 backbones of Hadoop which are Hadoop File System(HDFS), Yet Another Resource Negotiator(YARN), and MapReduce. We will also do a hands-on example of MapReduce on the European Football Club Market Value dataset, we will use the concept of MapReduce to find the frequency of the age of players in European football clubs.
