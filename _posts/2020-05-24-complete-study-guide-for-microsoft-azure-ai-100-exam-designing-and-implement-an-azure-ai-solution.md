I just passed the Microsoft Azure AI-100 exam which made me a Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate, I complied all the useful resources and definition that contributed to my success in the exam. 

[**What is Microsoft Azure AI-100 Exam**?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-engineer) This is the exam you have to pass to become a Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate, it involves designing and implementing an Azure AI solution. 

**What is expected from the candidates?** 

*	You should have subject matter expertise using cognitive services, machine learning, and knowledge mining to architect and implement Microsoft AI solutions involving natural language processing, speech, computer vision, and conversational AI.

*	You must be able to analyze the requirements for AI solutions, recommend appropriate tools and technologies and implements solutions that meet scalability and performance requirements.

*	You should be able to translate the vision from solution architects and work with data scientists, data engineers, IOT specialists, and AI developers to build complete end to end solutions.

*	You should have knowledge and experience designing and implementing AI apps and agents that use Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Service, Azure Cognitive Search, and data storage in Azure.

*	You should be able to recommend solutions that use open source technologies, understand the components that make up the Azure AI portfolio and the available data storage options, and understand when a custom API should be developed to meet specific requirements.

## My experience 
I wrote the exam on May 22, 2020 using the option of taking my exam “at home or office”. Before the day of the exam, I have spent about 70 hours preparing for the exam. I will share with you the details of the materials and the time spend on each material later. My exam was scheduled for 12:30 pm central European Time, on my schedule I have 210 minutes but the exam itself took 180 minutes (3 hours), the remaining 30 minutes was for surveys and reviews.

 I was in front of my computer by 12:00 pm and the "Begin Exam" button was already activated. I clicked "Begin Exam", as I said earlier, I am writing my exam from home. I was asked to download the OnVUE app, then I inserted my access code and phone number in the app. I was sent a URL by text message to my phone, on opening the URL, I was asked to upload of a picture of myself, my ID( passport or driving license), my desk(front), left, right, and back using my phone. After I uploaded everything correctly, I refreshed the OnVUE app on my computer then I got a message to wait for 15 minutes for a representative to contact me.  A representative chatted me up and told me to show her my 360 using my room with my laptop webcam because after uploading the pictures, phones are not allowed at arm's length. Note, you can’t use an external monitor if you are using a laptop. After the interaction with the representative, she gave me the exams. Few minutes to read instructions and accept terms and conditions, then 10 minutes survey on your level in Azure AI solutions, then  180 minutes(3 hours) for exams, then 10 minutes to review all my questions but you can’t change your answer during this review,  then finally a survey. 
 
During the 180 minutes for the exam, I was given 36 questions (I learnt the questions could vary from 30 - 50), my first 6 questions were the questions which you cannot select to be reviewed and changed later. There are two review sessions, first is during your 180 minutes and the other is during the 10 minutes after your submitting. You can review and change answers to questions selected for review in the first session but in the second session you have access to all your questions and you can't change answers. You are not required to type anything during the exam.

## About AI-100 Exam 

The exam costs $165 which varies based on country plus addition tax if applicable. There was a discount for students when I was wrote the exam, instead of 165 euros(since I live in Germany), I had to pay 91 euros and the 17.29 tax which summed up to be 108.29. Check details about the exam [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-100). The pass mark is 700, the question type varies from drag and drop to arrange in the right other to multiple-choice and so on. You are not required to type anything.
