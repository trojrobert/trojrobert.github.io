I just passed the Microsoft Azure AI-100 exam which made me a Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate, therefore I  decided to compile resources that contributed to my success in the exam.

[**What is Microsoft Azure AI-100 Exam**?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/azure-ai-engineer) This is the exam you must pass to become a Microsoft Azure AI Engineer Associate. it involves designing and implementing an Azure AI solution.

**What is expected from the candidates?** 

*	You should have subject matter expertise using cognitive services, machine learning, and knowledge mining to architect and implement Microsoft AI solutions involving natural language processing, speech, computer vision, and conversational AI.

*	You must be able to analyze the requirements for AI solutions, recommend appropriate tools and technologies and implement solutions that meet scalability and performance requirements.

*	You should be able to translate the vision from solution architects and work with data scientists, data engineers, IOT specialists, and AI developers to build complete end to end solutions.

*	You should have knowledge and experience designing and implementing AI apps and agents that use Microsoft Azure Cognitive Services, Azure Bot Service, Azure Cognitive Search, and data storage in Azure.

*	You should be able to recommend solutions that use open source technologies, understand the components that make up the Azure AI portfolio and the available data storage options, and understand when a custom API should be developed to meet specific requirements.

## My experience 
I wrote the exam on May 22, 2020 and opted for taking the exam at home the choosing the option “at home or office”. Before the day of the exam, I had spent about 70 hours preparing for the exam. I will share with you the details of the materials and the time spent on each material later. My exam was scheduled for 12:30 pm central European Time. 

 I was sited in front of my computer by 12:00 pm and the “Begin Exam” button was already activated. Upon clicking the “Begin Exam” button, I was required to download the OnVUE app. Afterwards, I inserted my access code and phone number in the app. Next,  I was sent a URL by text message to my phone. On opening the URL, I was asked to upload a picture of myself, my ID (passport or driving license),  and pictures of my desk(front), left, right, and back. After I uploaded everything correctly, I refreshed the OnVUE app on my computer then I got a message to wait for 15 minutes for a representative to contact me. A representative chatted me up and told me to show her my 360 view of my room with my laptop webcam. My webcam was used because after uploading the pictures, phones are not allowed at arm’s length. Note, you can’t use an external monitor if you are using a laptop. After the interaction with the representative, the exam commenced. I was given few minutes to read instructions and accept terms and conditions
 
The exam commenced with a 10 minutes survey. During the survey, I supplied self-ratings on my ability to develop AI solutions with Azure. The actual exam lasted was for 180 minutes (3 hours). I was given 36 questions (I learnt the questions could vary from 30–50). The first 6 questions and answers could not be reviewed later but answers to the remaining 30 could be changed if I selected the question for review. All questions can be answered using just the mouse, no typing is required. The question types vary from drag and drop, arrange in the right other, to multiple-choice and so on. I was given an additional 10 minutes to view all my questions and answers. Answers cannot be changed during this review. Lastly, a final survey followed. 

## About AI-100 Exam 

The pass mark for the exam is 700. The exam costs $165 and varies based on the country with additional taxes if applicable. There was a discount for students when I wrote the exam. Instead of 165 euros (I live in Germany), I had to pay 91 Euros and the 17.29 Euros tax which summed up to be 108.29 Euros. Check details about the exam [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/certifications/exams/ai-100).
