Deciding on the database to use for our application or workload can be very tricky. Since I join AWS Community Builder, I spend a least 1 hour every day exploring AWS services based on use case. Amazon Web Service(AWS) provides several options for Databases, we can be confused on the right one to choose.  This article is a documentation of what I learned and the resources I used in understanding the various databases in AWS and how to decide when to use them. I hope it will be of value to you. I will like to have feedback on what you think I should add or remove or improve on as I continue exploring AWS and other cloud services.

There are a lot of criteria the could help us in selecting the right database in AWS, to make it easier for us, we summarize it into the following 4 criteria 
1. **Type** of Data
2. **Size** of Data
3. **Structure or Shape** of Data
4. **Activities** that will be done on the Data

Now that we have an idea of the criteria required in selecting the database, let us dive into each of these databases. All databases in AWS are known to have the following properties 
* fully managed by AWS
* scalable that is increase and decrease based on demand 
* highly available that is the databases are guaranteed to be always up


# Relation Databases 

## Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS)

![Amazon RDS](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbzzslryr/image/upload/v1610989754/aws_databases/amazon_rds.png "Amazon RDS")

[source](https://www.drilling-aws.de/amazon-rds-preise/)

Amazon RDS is not a database itself instead it is used to set up, operate, and scale relational databases in the cloud. It enables us to provisioning  Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server. It is like an administrator for these databases. It automates failover, backups, restore, disaster recovery, access management, encryption, security, monitoring, and performance optimization.  It has two major backup solutions which are automated backups and manual snapshots. It has a maximum of 5 replicas. Its replicas can be multi-availability zone replica, cross-region replicas, and read replica. But the resources aren't replicated across AWS Regions by default expect you set it specifically.


#### When to use Amazon Relational Database Service(RDS)
If we need to use any of these six databases Amazon Aurora, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle Database, and SQL Server.

### Pricing 
[Amazon Relational Database Services(RDS) pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/pricing/) depends on either we are using it On-Demand or Reserved Instances.

## Amazon Aurora

Amazon Aurora has  MySQL and PostgreSQL compatibility, it is five times faster than standard MySQL and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL database. Amazon Aurora is 90% cheaper than standard MySQL and PostgreSQL databases.  It has a maximum size of 128 TB. Amazon Aurora defines a scaling policy of a maximum of 15 Aurora Replicas.  Aurora Backup and Failover are automatic. Amazon Aurora supports cross-region replication. Aurora MySQL DB Cluster and PostgreSQL are created using the Amazon Relation Database Service console.
Aurora Serverless gives Amazon Aurora the ability to automatically scale up, scale down, start-up, and shut down(auto-scaling). Aurora Serverless is best used when building an application that is not frequently used, building a new application, building an application with varying and unpredictable workloads.

# Data Warehousing 
## Amazon Redshift  

Amazon Redshift is columnar storage used for data warehousing, it is used to analyze and get insight from large data quickly by executing complex queries on them.  These data are usually at rest and historical data. It contains a cluster of nodes, it could be in single-node mode or multi-node mode. There are two types of nodes in Amazon Redshift, namely leader node and compute node. The leader node stores SQL endpoints, metadata, and coordinates parallel SQL processing. Compute nodes stores the data, and execute the queries. Amazon Redshift stores data on a single Availability Zone. Amazon Redshift spectrum is used to query Amazon Simple Storage Service(Amazon S3) directly. [Amazon Redshift federated queries](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/federated-overview.html) enables us to query and analyze live data across databases, data warehouses, and data lakes.

[Amazon Redshift Architecture - source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/c_high_level_system_architecture.html)

### When to use Amazon Redshift
for Online Analytical Processing

if we need to run queries across multiple data sources. For instance, we can copy data from different storages like Amazon EMR and Amazon S3 into Amazon Redshift. 

Amazon Redshift is suitable for generating reports for business intelligence

### Pricing 
[Amazon Redshiftp pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/) - the basic price for Amazon Redshift starts from $0.25 per hour.

[What is Amazon Redshift?](https://www.sumologic.com/blog/what-is-amazon-redshift/) By Kevin Goldberg

# NoSQL - Key/Value
## DynamoDB

DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, key/value, and document database. That is it support document and key/value structures. DynamoDB's major components are tables, items, attributes, keys, and values. A table is a collection of items and an item is a collection of attributes. Items are similar to rows while attributes are similar to columns in a traditional database. A key is used to identify attributes and value is the data itself. The Major API components in DynamoDB are control plane, data plane, DynamoDB streams, and transactions. On-Demand and Provisioned Mode are the read/write capacity modes in DynamoDB. Amazon DynamoDB provides us the ability to specific our Provisioned capacity based on Read Capacity Units(RCU) and Write Capacity Units(WCU). Amazon DynamoDB creates partitions based on size, Read Capacity Units and Write Capacity Units. The criteria required for partitioning are size of 10GB, RCU of 3000, and WCU of 1000.   Encrypt data at rest (that is inactive data), data that is not moving from one device to another or from one network to another.  DynamoDB has a Point in time recovery feature that is we can restore your data to any point in time. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator(DAX) enables us to manage write through cache on DynamoDB, it reduces response time from milliseconds to microseconds. Amazon DynamoDB uses SSD storage and stores its data across 3 different availability zone.

### When to use Amazon DynamoDB

for Online Transaction Processing(OTP).

to store real-time data from an IoT device.

to store activities and events on a web application such as clicks. 

to store items in a Web application like user profile, user events used by advertising, gaming, retail, finance, and media companies.

for Data that requires high request rate(millions of requests per seconds).

it is best used in situations that require high consistency.

### Pricing

# In memory 
## Amazon ElastiCache 

Amazon ElastiCache use to manage in-memory caching. Caching is storing data in a temporary storage area. This data is stored on the RAM which is volatile, that is the data can get lost easily and can be accessed fast. It stores frequently accessed data to improve performance, this helps to avoid application latency and throughput. It caches data from the database which is different from CloudFront(Content Delivery Network). Amazon ElastiCache stores important data in memory. Amazon Cloudfront stores static files, for example, HTML, audio, video, media files required by a web app. Amazon ElastiCache access only resources in the same VPC. 

![ElatiCache Redis vs Memcached](https://res.cloudinary.com/dbzzslryr/image/upload/v1611073857/aws_databases/elasticache_redis_memcached.png "ElatiCache Redis vs Memcached")
